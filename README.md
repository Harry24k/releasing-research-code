# My Paper Title

FixRes is a simple method for fixing the train-test resolution discrepancy. 
It can improve the performance of any convolutional neural network architecture.

The method is described in "Fixing the train-test resolution discrepancy" (Links: [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.06423),[NeurIPS](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/9035-fixing-the-train-test-resolution-discrepancy)).

Please notice that our models depend on previous trained models, see [References to other models](#references-to-other-models) 

> 📋Optional: include a graphic explaining your approach/main result, bibtex entry, link to demos, blog posts and tutorials

## Requirements

The FixRes code requires
* Python 3.6 or higher
* PyTorch 1.0 or higher

and the requirements highlighted in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) :

```setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> 📋Describe how to set up the environment, e.g. pip/conda/docker commands, download datasets, etc...

## Training

See help (`-h` flag) for detailed parameter list of each script before executing the code.
 
To train the model(s) in the paper, run this command:

```bash
# ResNet50
python main_resnet50_scratch.py --batch 64 --num-tasks 8 --learning-rate 2e-2

```

> 📋Describe how to train the models, with example commands on how to train the models in your paper, including the full training procedure and appropriate hyperparameters.

## Evaluation

See help (`-h` flag) for detailed parameter list of each script before executing the code.

`main_evaluate_imnet.py` evaluates the network on standard benchmarks.

`main_evaluate_softmax.py` evaluates the network on ImageNet-val with already extracted softmax output. (Much faster to execute)

```bash
# FixResNeXt-101 32x48d
python main_evaluate_imnet.py --input-size 320 --architecture 'IGAM_Resnext101_32x48d' --weight-path 'ResNext101_32x48d.pth'
```

The following code give results that corresponds to table 2 in the paper :
```
# FixResNet-50
python main_evaluate_imnet.py --input-size 384 --architecture 'ResNet50' --weight-path 'ResNet50.pth'
```

> 📋Describe how to evaluate the trained models on benchmarks reported in the paper, give commands that produce the results (section below).

### Using transforms_v2 for fine-tuning
To reproduce our best results we must use the data-augmentation of transforms_v2 and use almost the same parameters as for the classic data augmentation, the only changes are the learning rate which must be 1e-4 and the number of epochs which must be 11. For FixResNet-50 fine-tune you have to use 31 epochs and a learning rate of 1e-3 and for FixResNet-50 CutMix you have to use 11 epochs and a learning rate of 1e-3.
Here is how to use transforms_v2 :

```python
from torchvision import datasets
from .transforms_v2 import get_transforms

transform = get_transforms(input_size=Train_size,test_size=Test_size, kind='full', crop=True, need=('train', 'val'), backbone=None)
train_set = datasets.ImageFolder(train_path,transform=transform['val_train'])
test_set = datasets.ImageFolder(val_path,transform=transform['val_test'])
```

## Results

We provide pre-trained networks with differents trunks, we report in the table validation resolution, Top-1 and Top-5 accuracy on ImageNet validation set:

Our model achieves the following performance on :

(+)  We use Horizontal flip, shifted Center Crop and color jittering for fine-tuning (described in [transforms_v2.py](transforms_v2.py))

(+) We report different results with our FixEfficientNet (see [FixEfficientNet](README_FixEfficientNet.md) for more details)

To load a network, use the following PyTorch code: 

```python
import torch
from .resnext_wsl import resnext101_32x48d_wsl

model=resnext101_32x48d_wsl(progress=True) # example with the ResNeXt-101 32x48d 

pretrained_dict=torch.load('ResNeXt101_32x48d.pth',map_location='cpu')['model']

model_dict = model.state_dict()
for k in model_dict.keys():
    if(('module.'+k) in pretrained_dict.keys()):
        model_dict[k]=pretrained_dict.get(('module.'+k))
model.load_state_dict(model_dict)
```
The network takes images in any resolution. 
A normalization pre-processing step is used, with mean `[0.485, 0.456, 0.406]`. 
and standard deviation `[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]` for ResNet-50 and ResNeXt-101 32x48d,
use  mean `[0.5, 0.5, 0.5]` and standard deviation `[0.5, 0.5, 0.5]` with PNASNet.
You can find the code in transforms.py.
